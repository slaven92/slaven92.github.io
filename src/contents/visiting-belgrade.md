# What to do in Belgrade
## Best Churches In Belgrade

### Church Of Saint Sava
One of the most imposing landmarks in Belgrade, the massive Church of Saint Save, is the largest Serbian Orthodox church and one of the world’s biggest churches.

Located on the Vračar plateau, it’s visible from several locations in the city, dominating the cityscape. It’s constructed in a Byzantine-Revival style. A visit to this monumental structure is definitely one of the best things to do in Belgrade.

### Saborna Church
You can’t miss this huge church as it’s clear from the city’s center and over the River Sava. This church was built in the 19th century in neoclassic architecture, having survived Ottoman rule. 

If you’re an architecture buff, this is a must visit spot for you, and the neighborhoods around the church are well worth exploring on foot to find further hidden gems.

### Ruzica Church
There are many historical churches in Belgrade, but Ruzica is the oldest, located close to the fortress. Not only is this church beautiful in architecture and interior decoration, but it’s a functioning church that often hosts weddings throughout the shoulder months of the year. 

## Best Historical & Cultural Sites In Belgrade
### Kalemegdan Fortress
Most Balkan cities have some fortress, which varies in their state of dilapidation. And while parts of Belgrade are crumbling, the fortress is not among them.

Easily one of the best places to visit in Belgrade, the Kalemegdan Fortress rests over the confluence of the Danube and Sava, the two Belgrade rivers, and houses the city’s biggest and most lovely park.

It is the perfect place to spend a warm afternoon, drinking a beer and admiring the views of the city. The fortress is also home to one of the top museums in Belgrade and the Belgrade Zoo.

### Underground Roman Tunnels
The lush, green land around Kalemegdan Fortress is a must-visit, but dare you to head underground and check out the old Roman tunnels?

A network of tunnels was built over a century ago by the Romans, and you can head underground and explore these mysterious caverns, with the help of a guide, of course! 

### Pobednik Monument
This famous monument is called ‘The Victor,’ and here you’ll find stunning views over the whole city and the Danube. 

The monument was built to commemorate the victory over the Ottomans and Austro-Hungarians. 

### Republic Square
Situated at the southern end of Knez Mihailova, Republic Square is arguably the most important square in Belgrade. As a business and cultural district, this vibrant area in the Belgrade Old Town is where you’ll find major Belgrade sights like the Serbian National Theatre and the iconic Serbian National Museum, the latter of which is definitely worth visiting.

It’s a popular meeting place among locals and expats and one of the key tourist attractions in Belgrade.

## Best Museums In Belgrade
### The Tito Museum
While probably the most famous museum in Belgrade is the Nikola Tesla Museum, it focuses heavily on science and innovation. That certainly comes with its own audience, although it’s undoubtedly considered to be among the best Belgrade has to offer in terms of museums.

If you want to delve into Serbia’s and former Yugoslavia’s history a bit more, head to the Tito Museum. I knew very little about Yugoslavia’s controversial former leader, but I found this museum to be both fascinating and informative and absolutely worth the visit.

It’s one of the important places to visit in Belgrade to learn more about the city’s and country’s history.

### Nikola Tesla Museum
Located in the Belgrade city center, the Nikola Tesla Museum is dedicated to the life and work of Nikola Tesla, arguably the most famous Serb. This may be the best museum in the city, and a visit is definitely one of the best things to do in Belgrade, particularly if you like history and science.

The museum is home to more than 1,200 historical technical exhibits, over 2,000 journals and books, and an incredibly 160,000 original documents. It also has more than a thousand drawings and plans. Because of its exceptional wealth of items and the legacy of Tesla in terms of electricity-related inventions, it is part of UNESCO’s Memory of the World Program Register.

### Belgrade Military Museum
If you want to learn more about the military history of Serbia as a whole, the Belgrade Military Museum is a one-stop shop for everything you need to know. This museum is found in Kalemegdan Park, and you can visit it for free.

### National Museum of Serbia
The National Museum was founded by a decree of the Minister of Education Jovan Sterija Popovic on May 10, 1844 as Serbian Museum (Muzeum serbski) whose purpose was to collect antiquities in one place and to safeguard them for posterity. In the first decades of its work it was organised as an institution of protection but also as a scientific and research institution that constituted the national identity and was a crucial participant in the development of heritage protection. The National Museum soon grew into an official representative of the state and the society, testifying to a possible strength of culture and museums in Serbia.

### Princess Ljubica's Residence
Princess Ljubica's Residence is a palace located in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Because of its cultural and architectural importance the residence has been designated a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance.


## Best Streets, Neighborhoods & Districts In Belgrade
### Skadarlija Bohemian Quarter
Skadarlija, or the Bohemian quarter, might be the most touristy neighborhood in Belgrade. This isn’t, however, a reason to avoid it.

The picturesque cobbled streets in Belgrade’s old city are lined with shops and cafés. Some of the best Belgrade restaurants are also situated in this area. A stroll through this charming quarter is highly recommended for anyone visiting Belgrade in winter, summer, and throughout the year.

Whether looking for the best food in Belgrade, spending the afternoon shopping, or simply going on a casual stroll, Skadarlija is a great place to go in Belgrade. If you only have one day in Belgrade, put this area at the top of your Belgrade top sights list!

### Zemun
If you want to return in time, you must visit Zemun. A district full of incredible architecture, churches, and houses, Glavna is the street to be seen on, which runs right down to the Danube River. 

Don your comfortable walking shoes, as you can easily walk from the center of Belgrade to Zemun; it’s only 3km and a very picturesque walk along the river. There are also plenty of places for a pitstop coffee along the way. 

### Knez Mihailova Street
Another prominent street in the Belgrade city center is Knez Mihailova Street. In fact, this is actually the city’s main pedestrian and shopping street, one of the iconic places to see in Belgrade.

Lined by beautiful historic buildings housing stores of famous international brands like Sephora and Zara, as well as various restaurants, coffee shops, and bars, this wonderful street is officially protected as one of Belgrade’s oldest and most culturally valuable landmarks.

## Best Parks & Outdoor Recreation In Belgrade
### Tasmajdan Park
It’s always great to find a chunk of green space in a busy city, and Belgrade is no different. Tasmajdan Park is a beautiful space with tall trees and plenty of flora and fauna to check out. If you’re visiting with the kids, there’s plenty of space for them to run off steam, as well as game spots and a swimming complex. 

### Ada Ciganlija
Also known simply as Ada, Ada Ciganlija is an island in the Sava River in central Belgrade. Nicknamed “Belgrade’s Sea,” it’s one of the city’s largest and most popular recreation sites, home to various sports facilities and beaches.

In summer, it’s not uncommon for visitation numbers to exceed 100,000 on weekdays and even reach up to 300,000 on the weekends. Activities range from kayaking, swimming, sunbathing, and rowing to playing golf, and tennis, relaxing in the shade of a tree and playing basketball.

## Day Trips From Belgrade, Serbia
### Novi Sad
Only about an hour’s train ride north of Belgrade, Serbia’s second-largest city of Novi Sad, is an excellent option if you want to see a more mellow, laid-back side of Serbia.

Home to the country’s largest and internationally famous music festival, called EXIT, Novi Sad is already on the map for many younger travelers.

Easy to get to from Budapest or even as a day trip from Belgrade, Novi Sad is a can’t-miss city in Serbia. And don’t let the dingy, a grey area around the bus/train station fool you; Novi Sad is a lovely city once you venture into the Old Town!

Probably the highlight of Novi Sad is its massive fortress in the city center. The fortress is home to the Novi Sad City Museum, an observatory, and planetarium, and several restaurants and cafés. The Petrovaradin Fortress hosts the famous EXIT Festival every summer, but it is also a fantastic place to explore any other time of year.
